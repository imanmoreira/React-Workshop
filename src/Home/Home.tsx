          <h2>Welcome to Sandbox Everyone!</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the SandBucks for your local coffee needs. We need help
            designing our website, since as you can see it's a bit ... lacking.
            We have the backbone of the website set up and have a list of
            features and pages that we would like added so we can get to selling
            coffee and making an impact!
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out the README for your next task! The useful area of code is
            also marked with a **TODO** to let you know where to look.
          </p>
          <p>Have fun everyone :)</p>
